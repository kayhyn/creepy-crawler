# creepy-crawler
Python web crawler to find broken links, unused content, and more

install the requirements.txt 
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

and then run 
    `./creepy-crawler --help` 

to see some options.

you might just want to try `creepy-crawler crawl <website>` since unless 
you have access to a live server the `report` feature will not be of much use.
